# WebSocket Testing Tasks

## ✅ RESOLVED - WebSocket Reconnection Loop Issue

**Status**: FIXED - Connection now stable
**Root Cause**: useEffect dependency loop in GameInterface component  
**Fix**: Removed connectToSession from useEffect dependencies

**Verification**: ✅ WebSocket connection stable, no reconnection loops
**Result**: Ready for multi-client testing

---

## ✅ RESOLVED - Critical Issues Fixed

### ✅ Issue 1: Voting State Synchronization Failure (FIXED)
**Status**: RESOLVED ✅
**Root Cause**: Infinite event loops - `VOTING_STARTED` and `VOTES_REVEALED` events were re-triggering themselves
**Fix**: Added `fromEvent` parameter to prevent event loops when handling received events
**Multi-Client Testing**: Implemented `?client=X` URL parameter for separate localStorage namespaces

**Verification**: ✅ **WORKING PERFECTLY**
- Alice creates session → Bob joins with different client ID ✅
- Alice starts voting → Both clients receive voting interface ✅  
- Both players vote → Results synchronized across clients ✅
- Average calculation correct → Consensus logic working ✅

### ✅ Issue 2: Session ID Case Sensitivity (FIXED)
**Status**: RESOLVED ✅
**Issue**: `.toUpperCase()` in JoinSession component caused session ID mismatch
**Fix**: Removed automatic uppercase conversion from session ID input

### ✅ Issue 3: Multi-Client Testing Infrastructure (IMPLEMENTED)
**Status**: COMPLETED ✅
**Solution**: URL parameter `?client=X` creates separate localStorage namespaces
**Usage**: 
- `http://localhost:3000?client=alice` (Alice's client)
- `http://localhost:3000?client=bob` (Bob's client)  
- `http://localhost:3000?client=charlie` (Charlie's client)
