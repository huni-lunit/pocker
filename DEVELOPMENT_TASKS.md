# Planning Poker Web Application - Development Tasks

## Project Overview
A Next.js-based planning poker application for agile teams to estimate story points collaboratively. No backend server required - all data is stored client-side during the session.

## Core Features Analysis (Based on Screenshots)

### 1. Main Game Interface
- **Player Grid Layout**: Dynamic grid layout supporting 1-10 players (responsive arrangement)
- **Card Selection**: Bottom interface with numbered cards (configurable sets)
- **Central Prompt**: "Pick your cards!" during voting, "Start new voting" for next round
- **User Indicator**: Current user highlighted with blue outline

### 2. Voting Results Display
- **Individual Votes**: Shows each player's selected card
- **Average Calculation**: Displays calculated average (e.g., "1.8")
- **Agreement Indicator**: Green checkmark for consensus
- **Vote Count**: Shows participation (e.g., "1 Vote", "4 Votes")

### 3. Game Settings
- **Game Facilitator**: Dropdown selection from current session players
- **Game Name**: Text input
- **Voting System**: Two predefined options - [1,2,3,4,5] or [0,1,2,3,4,5,6] (custom decks for future)
- **Permissions**: "Everyone" or specific players from current session
- **Feature Toggles**: Auto-reveal, show average

### 4. Voting History
- **Session Tracking**: result, agreement status
- **Detailed Results**: date, vote count(voted count, total count), player results(name, vote score)

## Development Tasks Breakdown

### Phase 1: Project Setup & Core Infrastructure
- [x] **Setup Next.js Project**
  - Initialize Next.js with TypeScript
  - Install dependencies: Tailwind CSS, React hooks, state management

  - Set up project structure

- [x] **Design System & UI Components**
  - Create reusable Button component
  - Build Card component for voting
  - Implement Modal component for settings/history
  - Design Input, Toggle, and Dropdown components
  - Set up Tailwind configuration for consistent styling
  - Create responsive grid layout component for 1-10 players

### Phase 2: User Management & Session
- [x] **User Join Interface**
  - Create username input screen
  - Implement session creation/joining logic
  - Generate unique session codes
  - Local storage for user preferences
  - Enforce 10-player session limit

- [x] **State Management**
  - Set up React Context or Zustand for game state
  - Define data structures for players, votes, sessions
  - Implement state persistence during session
  - Create state update functions
  - Handle dynamic player count and grid layout calculations

### Phase 3: Core Voting Functionality
- [x] **Main Game Screen**
  - Build dynamic player grid layout (1-10 players, responsive arrangement)
  - Implement responsive design for different screen sizes and player counts
  - Add current user highlighting
  - Create player status indicators
  - Add session player limit (max 10 players)

- [x] **Card Voting System**
  - Implement card selection interface with predefined sets: [1,2,3,4,5] and [0,1,2,3,4,5,6]
  - Add card interaction animations
  - Handle vote submission logic
  - Implement vote validation
  - Support dynamic card set switching

- [x] **Voting Session Flow**
  - Dynamic prompt system: "Pick your cards!" during voting, "Start new voting" for next round
  - Vote collection and synchronization
  - Card reveal mechanism
  - Session state transitions
  - Round management and reset functionality

### Phase 4: Results & Analytics
- [x] **Results Display**
  - Show individual player votes
  - Calculate and display average
  - Implement agreement indicator logic
  - Add vote count display
  - Create "Start new voting" functionality

- [x] **Voting History (Optional)**
  - Track completed voting sessions
  - Display session history in modal
  - Show detailed results per session
  - Add export functionality
  - Include duration and timestamp data

### Phase 5: Advanced Features ‚úÖ
- [x] **Game Settings**
  - Build comprehensive settings modal
  - Implement facilitator selection from current session players
  - Add voting system configuration with predefined sets: [1,2,3,4,5] and [0,1,2,3,4,5,6]
  - Create permission management ("Everyone" or specific session players)
  - Add feature toggles (auto-reveal, fun features, show averages, countdown animation)
  - Prepare structure for future custom deck management

- [x] **Real-time Synchronization**
  - Implement WebRTC communication
  - Sync votes across all players
  - Handle connection management
  - Add reconnection logic (e.g. when the user is offline, the votes will be saved and will be synced when the user is back online)

- [x] **Fun Features (Optional)**
  - Player projectile throwing interactions using emojis (only ‚ò∫Ô∏è üôè üòç ‚ù§Ô∏è four emojis)
  - Add celebration animations for consensus
  - Create interactive player avatars
  - Respect enableFunFeatures setting from game configuration
  - Celebrations when the votes has consensus (e.g. fireworks) which means the votes are the same


### Phase 6: Polish & Optimization
- [ ] **Performance Optimization**
  - Code splitting and lazy loading
  - Optimize re-renders
  - Implement proper error boundaries
  - Add loading states

## Technical Considerations

### No Backend Requirements
- All data stored in browser memory/localStorage
- Real-time sync via WebRTC or client-side WebSocket
- Session data expires when all users leave
- No persistent storage needed

### Key Technologies
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14+, React 18+, TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, CSS Modules
- **State Management**: React Context or Zustand
- **Real-time**: WebRTC, WebSocket, or Socket.IO client
- **Build**: Vercel, Netlify, or static hosting

### Priority Order
1. **Primary**: Core voting functionality (Phases 1-3)
2. **Secondary**: Results display and basic settings (Phase 4)
3. **Optional**: Advanced features and history (Phase 5)
4. **Enhancement**: Polish and optimization (Phase 6)

## Success Metrics
- [ ] Users can join with username
- [ ] Card selection works smoothly
- [ ] Real-time vote synchronization
- [ ] Results display with averages
- [ ] Session management without backend
- [ ] Mobile responsive design
- [ ] Intuitive user experience

## Notes
- Focus on voting functionality first
- History feature is optional but nice-to-have
- No data persistence beyond session (e.g. when all the user leaves the page for more than 10 minutes, the session will be lost)
- Prioritize user experience over complex features
