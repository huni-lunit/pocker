# Docker Build Fixes

This document explains the issues that were identified and fixed in the Docker builds for both the web application and signaling server.

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Web Application Build Issues

#### Problem: ESLint Errors Preventing Build
The Next.js build was failing due to ESLint errors in `src/components/GameInterface.tsx`:

- **Missing dependencies in useEffect**: `connectToSession` was missing from dependency array
- **Conditional useEffect hook**: A `useEffect` hook was placed after an early return statement, violating React hooks rules

#### Solution:
- ✅ Added missing `connectToSession` dependency to useEffect
- ✅ Moved all `useEffect` hooks before the early return statement
- ✅ Consolidated duplicate countdown event listener useEffect

#### Fixed Code:
```typescript
// Before: Missing dependency and conditional hook
useEffect(() => {
  if (realTimeSync && session && currentUserId && connectionStatus === 'disconnected') {
    connectToSession()
  }
}, [realTimeSync, session, currentUserId, connectionStatus]) // Missing connectToSession

// useEffect after early return - WRONG!

// After: All dependencies included and hooks before early return
useEffect(() => {
  if (realTimeSync && session && currentUserId && connectionStatus === 'disconnected') {
    connectToSession()
  }
}, [realTimeSync, session, currentUserId, connectionStatus, connectToSession])

// All useEffect hooks moved before early return
if (!session || !currentUserId) {
  return null
}
```

### 2. Signaling Server Build Issues

#### Problem: Missing Dependencies Stage
The Dockerfile referenced a `deps` stage that didn't exist:

```dockerfile
# This line failed because 'deps' stage was not defined
COPY --from=deps /app/node_modules ./node_modules
```

#### Solution:
- ✅ Added proper multi-stage build with separate `deps` stage
- ✅ Optimized dependency installation for production

#### Fixed Dockerfile:
```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Dependencies (NEW)
FROM node:18-alpine AS deps
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production

# Stage 2: Builder
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
COPY tsconfig.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY src/ ./src/
RUN npm run build

# Stage 3: Runner
FROM node:18-alpine AS runner
WORKDIR /app
RUN addgroup --system --gid 1001 websocket
RUN adduser --system --uid 1001 signaling
COPY --from=deps /app/node_modules ./node_modules  # Now works!
COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist
COPY --from=builder /app/package*.json ./
USER signaling
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["node", "dist/server.js"]
```

## Build Verification

Both builds now work correctly and have been tested:

### Web Application
- ✅ ESLint passes without errors
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ Next.js build completes successfully
- ✅ Container starts and serves the application
- ✅ Health check endpoint responds correctly

### Signaling Server
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ Multi-stage build completes without errors
- ✅ Container starts and runs the WebSocket server
- ✅ Server logs "Signaling server running on port 8080"
- ✅ Health check endpoint available

## Testing

Run the test script to verify both builds:

```bash
./test-builds.sh
```

This script will:
1. Build both Docker images
2. Start both containers
3. Verify they start correctly
4. Clean up test containers
5. Report success/failure

## Deployment Ready

Both Docker builds are now ready for:
- ✅ Local development with Docker
- ✅ Kubernetes deployment
- ✅ Production environments
- ✅ CI/CD pipelines

## Key Improvements

1. **Reliability**: Fixed all build-breaking errors
2. **Performance**: Optimized multi-stage builds
3. **Security**: Proper non-root user setup
4. **Maintainability**: Clear, documented build process
5. **Testing**: Automated verification script

## Next Steps

1. Use the fixed builds with the Kubernetes deployment:
   ```bash
   ./deploy.sh deploy
   ```

2. For manual builds:
   ```bash
   # Web application
   docker build -t pocker-web:latest .
   
   # Signaling server
   docker build -t pocker-signaling:latest ./signaling-server
   ```

3. For testing:
   ```bash
   ./test-builds.sh
   ```
